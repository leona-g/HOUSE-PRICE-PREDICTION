# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION

Introduction:

In the realm of real estate, predicting house prices accurately is a complex task that involves understanding various factors influencing property values. This project aimed to create an advanced house price prediction model using regression techniques. The dataset initially consisted of 1460 rows and 81 columns, with thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and feature selection employed to enhance the modeling process.

Approach:

The initial dataset underwent a comprehensive EDA to uncover patterns and insights, followed by strategic feature engineering to extract relevant information. Feature selection techniques were then applied to streamline the dataset, resulting in a final set of 21 features deemed crucial for modeling.

Regression Techniques:

Four regression algorithms—Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor—were employed to predict house prices based on the selected features.

Results:

The model performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared metrics:

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Mean Squared Error: 0.019201
   - R-squared: 0.897111

2. **Decision Tree Regressor:**
   - Mean Squared Error: 0.041586
   - R-squared: 0.777153

3. **Random Forest Regressor:**
   - Mean Squared Error: 0.020494
   - R-squared: 0.890177

4. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR):**
   - Mean Squared Error: 0.021062
   - R-squared: 0.887134

5. **Stacking Regressor:**
   - Mean Squared Error: 0.017829
   - R-squared: 0.904460

Conclusion:

The stacking regressor, an ensemble model combining predictions from multiple regression algorithms, outperformed individual models in terms of mean squared error and R-squared. This highlights the efficacy of stacking in leveraging the strengths of diverse models to achieve superior predictive performance. The stacking approach demonstrated an improved ability to capture complex relationships within the dataset, resulting in a more accurate representation of house prices.

This project's success underscores the importance of thorough data exploration, thoughtful feature engineering, and strategic model selection. The insights gained not only contribute to predicting house prices more accurately but also provide valuable knowledge for stakeholders in the dynamic real estate market.
